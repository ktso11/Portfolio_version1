# About Me v1

Thank you for visiting my 'About Me' site. 

I created this page as a part of General Assembly's Project 1 requirement. The goal was to create a site to display my work and share some information about me. 

HTML, CSS, JS and Jquery was used to create this site. I wanted to create a design with minimal pictures, so you will find that my CSS has the most codes. Flex box was heavily used in this design, and Jquery to create the interactions, such as: the carousel, smooth scrolling, and animate effects.  

This site is best viewed with Google Chrome. Although there are media queries to support tablet view (max-width: 590px), mobile version lower than 590px is currently not supported. It is still a working process :)
